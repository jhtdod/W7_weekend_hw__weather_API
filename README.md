# Weather Forecast Web App

A weather app that shows the 7 day forecast for Edinburgh. It was created as a way to practise React, external API fetches & session storage, and to learn how to integrate charts into React. Built using React, including React-Bootstrap and react-chartjs-2, and CSS.

There are still some issues with the responsiveness of the app which need to be sorted out, but following that the aim is to include the forecast for additional locations.
