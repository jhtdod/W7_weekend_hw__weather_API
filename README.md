# Weather Forecast Web App

A weather app that shows the 7 day forecast for Edinburgh. It was created as a way to practise React, external API fetches & session storage, and to learn how to integrate charts into React. Built using React, including React-Bootstrap and react-chartjs-2.

The next aim is to include the forecast for other locations.
